Encrypted credentials manager
=============================


<span id="anchor"></span>General info
-------------------------------------

This is a simple project that I wrote for myself to have some of my credentials store safely.

Current version is not well tested and some function is still missing for example deleting any account.


<span id="anchor"></span>Simple use case example
---------------------------------------------

Loading saved account, adding new account, getting encrypted field
```
from passwordDbMain.Account import Fields, Account, getFieldsList
from passwordDbMain.PasswordDB import PasswordDB


# init of core class, on init loads saved accounts
# on default file is where main class is
# pathToDbFile= *args can be use to change that
pwDb = PasswordDB("H2")   # takes password as argument max 32 chars

# set save to True to allow saving credentials in a file
pwDb.setAutoSave(True)

# creating any account
newAcc = Account("name","login","password1","password2") # second password is optional

# adding account to memory and file
# if identical credentials where provided(e.g. while loading) acc will not be saved
pwDb.addAccount(newAcc)

# a way for getting account object from core object
acc = pwDb.getAccount("name")

# getting decrypted value
print(acc.getDecryptedAttribute(Fields.LOGIN))

# this will return list of all allowed Fields e.x
print(getFieldsList())
# ['NAME', 'LOGIN', 'PASSWORD1', 'PASSWORD2']
```
